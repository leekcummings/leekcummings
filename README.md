I'm a Computer Science student at Simmons University, graduating in 2026. I'm interested in command line tools, prime numbers, making my life easier with code. I'm proficient in Python, R, JavaScript, Bash, and HTML/CSS.

### [Prime Calculator](https://github.com/leekcummings/prime-calculator)

Run this Python code to generate a bunch of primes quickly. On my laptop I could get primes up to 10,000,000 calculated in under 30 seconds by utilizing a hash table.
