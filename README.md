# Hi there, I'm Lee 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at Simmons University, graduating in 2026. I'm interested in command line tools, prime numbers, making my life easier with code. I'm proficient in Python, R, JavaScript, Bash, and HTML/CSS.

### [Kitty Companion](https://github.com/leekcummings/kitty-companion)

This project was completed during the 24 hour, Simmons University SharkHack. We designed a desktop kitten, that walks around the screen, and interacts with the user by reminding them to take care of themself. In 24 hours, we made a lot of progress, but obviously there's plenty more to be done with the project. Thank you to the SharkHack judges for awarding our team The Humanity-Driven Innovation Award for Kitty Companion.

### [Simmons Finals Scheduling Application](https://github.com/leekcummings/finals-scheduler)

I've completed the challenege posed by the Simmons CS departmment to produce a final schedule for all Simmons students with no student conflicts. There are definitely changes I would love to make to the program, but I would need more information about the process behind scheduling finals that I don't currently have access to. I had fun learning how to use sets in Python.

### [Prime Calculator](https://github.com/leekcummings/prime-calculator)

Run this Python code to generate a bunch of primes quickly. On my laptop I could get primes up to 10,000,000 calculated in under 30 seconds by utilizing a hash table.
